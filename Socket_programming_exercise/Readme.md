# Socket Programming Exercise
This exercise contains a simple client socket programmin application which can be used by users to send different HTTP requests to a server. The point of this exercise is to get familiar with socket programming in C, especially creating a non-blocking socket, using timeouts, and using the `socket()`, `connect()`, `send()`, `recv()`, `poll()`, `setsockopt()` and `close()` functions.

**Note:** The program does not verify the JSON inputs provided by the user. The program does not anlayse the response provided. The response is simply printed to the console.

**Note**: The program only runs on Linux OS.
